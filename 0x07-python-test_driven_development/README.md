At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:
* Why Python programming is awesome
* Whatâ€™s an interactive test
* Why tests are important
* How to write Docstrings to create tests
* How to write documentation for each module and function
* What are the basic option flags to create tests
* How to find edge cases
